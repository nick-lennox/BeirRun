# BeirRun

BeirRun is a two dimensional and birds eye view game where the user controls a player who needs to collect drinks. The more drinks you collect the harder the controls get, the more distorted the graphics get and the more distorted the audio gets.

*Note*: The artwork for this game was done by [GuttyKreum](https://guttykreum.itch.io/) who is a super talented pixel artist. Check out their artwork!
